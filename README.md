# WiFi_thermometer

WiFi enabled, two channel thermometer using an esp8266 and two Adafruit MAX31855 breakout boards. The temperature data is displayed and plotted on the web portal. 

This program actually uses a MAX31855 and a MAX31856 since I accidentaly bought two different boards, but it could be modified too use two of the same board. 

Requirements:
WiFi manager: https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager
Adafruit MAX31855 library:https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MAX31855-library
Adafruit MAX31856 library:https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MAX31856
