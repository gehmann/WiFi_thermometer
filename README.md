# WiFi_thermometer

WiFi enabled, two channel thermometer using an esp8266 and two Adafruit MAX31865 breakout boards. The temperature data is displayed and plotted on the web portal. 

This program actually uses a MAX31865 and a MAX31866 since I accidentaly bought two different boards, but it could be modified too use two of the same board.
